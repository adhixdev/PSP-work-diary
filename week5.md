# Week Five

## Task Completed
During this sprint week, we focused on implementing core functionalities and refining the project. We successfully integrated several key features and addressed feedback received on 20/02/25. Additionally, I completed the STAR report.

## Feedback and Tasks to Implement

### **Call Management:**
- Implement a system where calls can be recorded and tied to cases automatically to streamline the process.
- Allow admins to log cases directly during calls to improve efficiency.

### **Role Table Structure:**
- Design a more flexible role management system, possibly using a role hierarchy or permission sets to clearly differentiate between admin, user manager, and agent roles.
- Create a dedicated roles table in the database to manage permissions and responsibilities efficiently.

### **Admin and User Management:**
- Increase the number of admin roles to handle a higher volume of cases and distribute workloads evenly.
- Allow user managers to oversee agents and manage case assignments effectively.

### **Account Creation:**
- Enable admins to create new accounts directly through the database interface to simplify the onboarding process for new agents.

### **Design and User Interface:**
- Focus on user-friendly design and styles that enhance the user experience.
- Implement intuitive navigation and visually appealing layouts to make the system more engaging.

### **Role Management:**
- Develop a robust role management system that allows for easy assignment of roles and permissions.
- Ensure that managers can view and track cases assigned to their team members, promoting accountability and oversight.

### **Case Tracking:**
- Implement a feature where managers can view cases created by their team, along with details like timestamps and status updates.
- Consider adding a dashboard for managers that visualizes their team's performance metrics.



## Task To Do
- Modify the system to be **admin-based** instead of client-based.
- Implement the above feedback points into the project.
- Further optimize call management and case handling processes.
- Enhance role-based access control to improve security and efficiency.
- Implement additional UI/UX refinements based on user feedback.
- Conduct final testing before deployment to ensure system stability.

## Issues
- Need to confirm specific admin role permissions and access levels.
- Ensure seamless transition from client-based to admin-based structure.
- Address any performance issues that arise from new feature implementations.
- Collect additional feedback from users to fine-tune functionalities.
