# Week Three

## Task Completed
This week, we finalized the user stories, ensuring all functionalities and interactions were well-defined. We also addressed any loose ends from previous discussions and started exploring Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) to map out the database structure.

## Task To Do
Our next steps include finalizing the ERDs and defining system interactions. We need to start creating the ERDs and transition towards the production phase of the project.

## Issues
Some aspects of the database structure require further refinement. Ensuring that the ERDs align with the user stories and project requirements is critical before moving forward.
