# Week Seven  

## Task Completed  
This week, we focused on refining the dashboard's backend logic.  
- Key statistics and case summaries are now displayed correctly.  
- Query optimizations have been implemented for better data retrieval performance.  
- Error handling mechanisms were introduced to prevent crashes.  
- Initial testing has been conducted to validate the implementation.  

## Task To Do  
- Continue optimizing database queries for efficiency.  
- Implement additional validation checks to ensure data accuracy.  
- Enhance error handling to prevent potential failures.  
- Conduct rigorous testing to verify stability and correctness.  

## Issues  
- Some queries require further optimization to improve performance.  
- Minor inconsistencies in displayed statistics need validation.  
- Error handling mechanisms need to cover more edge cases.
