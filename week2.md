# Week Two

## Task Completed
This week, we had our client meeting where we gathered key insights into their requirements, expectations, and objectives for the project. Based on the discussion, we started working on user stories to outline different interactions and functionalities required in the system.

## Task To Do
We need to refine and expand the user stories based on further analysis. Additionally, we should start mapping out the initial wireframes or flow diagrams to visualize user interactions.

## Issues
Some requirements from the client need further clarification. We should follow up to ensure that all necessary details are captured before proceeding with development planning.
